# Active-Directory-Administration-Lab-

## Objective
[Brief Objective]

This guided project demonstrates my hands-on experience in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) administration. Through practical exercises, I deployed domain controllers, managed AD DS objects, configured Group Policy, enforced security policies, and optimized directory services within a Windows Server environment.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points]

- Deploy and manage AD DS domain controllers.
- Configure Active Directory topology.
- Create and manage AD DS objects.
- Create and configure Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in AD DS.
- Manage security in AD DS.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in IT. 
  

  

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points]

- Hyper-V on Windows10/11 - Used to create and manage the virtualized environment hosting the Windows Server VMs.
- Windows Server 2022 - This serves as the Domain Controller and Domain Member Server for hands-on AD DS configuration.
- Active Directory - Used to manage domain controllers, configure directory topology, create and organize objects, apply security policies with Group Policy, and enforce authentication rules.
- Powershell - Used to create a NAT network with administrater access.
